# Project Status

Current phase: P0 Foundation and Compatibility
Release level: P0-software-verified

## P0A Foundation

- State: complete
- Evidence: [CI run 29273568922](https://github.com/n1ck8131/home_gateway/actions/runs/29273568922) passed Linux `make verify`, `go test -race`, the `CAP_NET_ADMIN` network prerequisite, Windows bootstrap, and Windows dev verification for commit `cf1773955e3d796e425cb6d6b75053928d77de61`.

## P0B Compatibility

- State: complete
- Evidence: [OpenWrt SDK run 29273568884](https://github.com/n1ck8131/home_gateway/actions/runs/29273568884) produced byte-identical outputs from two clean build trees for the pinned AWG2 packages and userspace contingency at commit `cf1773955e3d796e425cb6d6b75053928d77de61`.

## Next phase

- P1 Policy Core: not-started (explicitly deferred by the owner).

## External gates

- GL-MT6000 hardware smoke, including exact-kernel module/UAPI verification: not-run
- Router-to-VPS AWG2 handshake: P3 gate
- Second VPS failover: P9 gate
- Cisco field test: P7 gate

## Blockers

- P0 software blockers: none
- Hardware evidence remains intentionally deferred to the phase gates above; P0 does not claim hardware compatibility or throughput.
