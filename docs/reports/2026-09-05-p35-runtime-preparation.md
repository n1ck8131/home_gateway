# Phase 3.5 runtime preparation

Phase 3.5 is in progress and has not passed its live gates. The protected prerequisite from 3.4 is intact but expired for runtime preparation. The failed-Prepare ownership correction passed final offline verification and independent review. The exact read-only refresh candidate is ready for approval.

This report serves the P3 controller and independent reviewer. Its single purpose is to record preparation evidence against the [phase execution plan](../superpowers/plans/2026-09-05-p35-runtime-helper-lifecycle.md). It is not runtime acceptance.

## Verified starting state

Work uses branch `phase/p3-5-runtime-lifecycle` in the existing `p3-redshield-windows` worktree, based on `2bb8171aa7087ca7e4021b64ad115e289a9d5f27`. Root `main` and its modified `PLAN.md` are outside this change. Existing untracked Python caches and `testResults.xml` are preserved.

The [3.4 report](2026-09-05-p34-prerequisite-observation.md) remains the historical acceptance record. A local read-only readiness probe at `2026-09-05T09:45:27.9253263Z` returned:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Actual `New-P3ManifestPlan` | `blocked_prerequisite_expired` |
| Prerequisite observation | `2026-09-05T09:26:22.7940861Z` |
| Age at probe / allowed age | 1145 / 600 seconds |
| Receipt SHA-256 | `a87dd9aaa441a1e2657ac90e4a1d30a35db5e5ebea672bcf19cacc8cae765101`, unchanged |
| Protected prerequisite files | Six |
| Consumption marker | Absent |
| Proposed runtime root | Absent |
| SSH-agent / ssh-add process counts | 0 / 0 |
| Live action | None |

The probe validated the protected file set and static trust bindings before testing freshness. It did not substitute an earlier clock, edit a timestamp, start an agent, or open a server connection.

## Failed-Prepare correction

The original `Invoke-P3RuntimePrepare` rejected an existing runtime root inside a `try` block. Its `catch` then recursively deleted that root. Synthetic regression tests reproduced deletion of an existing directory and sentinel, and deletion of foreign nested content after an injected failure.

The correction creates the directory exclusively with its protected ACL and holds root and ancestor handles without delete sharing during preparation. A failed operation retains partial state and the consumed prerequisite, preventing ambiguous replay. A retained partial root requires inspected, separately approved recovery; the normal validator does not certify an incomplete bundle.

The native API contract was checked against Microsoft's [NtCreateFile reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/winternl/nf-winternl-ntcreatefile) and [CreateFileW reference](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/api/fileapi/nf-fileapi-createfilew). Native local tests cover file/directory collisions, racing creation, root and ancestor rename rejection, handle release, and a trailing directory separator. Final runtime script SHA-256: `e7446351afe211b63580359cfaa4f6c5a74dc478c4b71efe77e0667dd03eb096`.

## Prepared read-only refresh candidate

The local builder `build-phase35-refresh-candidate-v2.ps1` produced a protected five-file package under ignored `.p3-vps-run/p35-refresh-candidate-v2/`. It contains a sanitized candidate contract, prerequisite and agent plans, and a CurrentUser DPAPI-encrypted observation input. The source receipt remains unchanged; the future observation directory does not exist. The earlier v1 package is preserved but superseded because a trailing-separator compatibility correction changed the driver hash.

| Identity | SHA-256 or challenge |
| --- | --- |
| Candidate contract | `f6fe3f6d56ffbf820819027a6d6291ef6bfeb6f63c373dfca643432abcba96e1` |
| Prerequisite plan | `c86c29a46f4aef5277d65d9b5f869472cf79864add0192e23c6f4c3254117fec` |
| Prerequisite challenge | `P3-PRELIVE-PREREQUISITE-C86C29A46F4AEF52` |
| Agent plan | `dc1087ceeff3901c260cf4131e149fab2b089929817a292974e25d276f5a413c` |
| Agent challenge | `P3-SSH-AGENT-DC1087CEEFF3901C` |

The contract pins the encrypted input and five production driver hashes. It permits one SSH observation and three HTTPS authorities, requires fresh authenticated Cloud Firewall evidence, and stops on baseline drift. Freeze the new Cloud observation file hash before agent startup and revalidate it before SSH and receipt assembly. Mandatory `finally` teardown applies to the dedicated memory-only agent. The package explicitly excludes runtime preparation and helper installation.

This is an observation-input and approval package, not an executed runner or a fresh receipt. Use the pinned production prerequisite driver after exact approval. A runtime manifest/challenge does not yet exist.

## Validation evidence

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Initial focused regression cases | RED reproduced: 1 passed, 3 failed; only synthetic TestDrive paths |
| Candidate builder, Windows PowerShell 5.1 | Exit 0; five protected files; readback passed; no live action |
| `python -B -m unittest discover -s tests/python -q` | Exit 0; 56 tests passed |
| `ruff check .` | Exit 0 |
| `ruff format --check .` | Exit 1; inherited formatting in unchanged `2026-08-30-p3-task6a-prelive-guard.md`; 59 files already formatted |
| Focused runtime Pester, Windows PowerShell 5.1 and PowerShell 7 | 43/43 each; the final trailing-separator test also passed separately in both versions |
| Initial `scripts/dev.ps1 -Command verify` | Exit 0; 248 Pester tests; Go suite, analysis, secret, reproducible build, governance and toolchain gates passed |
| Final `scripts/dev.ps1 -Command verify` after trailing-separator correction | Exit 0; 248 passed, 0 failed/skipped; Go suite, build, static analysis, gosec 0, vulnerability/secret scans, governance and toolchain gates passed |
| Final candidate readback | Five driver hashes match; candidate/source receipt hashes unchanged; runtime and observation roots absent; zero agent processes |
| Consolidated independent review | GO for offline correction and requesting exact read-only refresh approval; 0 Critical, 0 Important, 0 Minor |

No Python source changed. The inherited Ruff formatting failure also appears in the 3.4 report; this phase does not reformat that historical plan.

The independent reviewer decrypted the V2 input only in memory and verified canonical plan/challenge equality, the encrypted input hash, all five driver hashes, restrictive ACLs, absent observation root, and zero agent processes. No additional server connection or live action was used for review.

## Remaining gates

The next eligible action is a separately approved read-only prerequisite refresh. Previously accepted hashes are expected identities only. Fresh authenticated-browser Cloud Firewall evidence, one pinned SSH observation, and three HTTPS authorities must establish a new receipt. Stop on baseline or trust drift.

Only that fresh receipt can produce the exact runtime manifest and challenge. Runtime preparation and helper installation keep their own approval gates. Phase 3.6 profiles, phase 3.7 activation, and later network/recovery work remain outside this report.

No SSH, HTTPS egress probe, DigitalOcean observation, helper installation, runtime preparation, profile action, or live network change has been executed in this phase preparation.
